        <h3>What I’m working on at the moment: Website update (12/05/2021)</h3>
        <p>Lately I've just been tweaking and adding little things to the website.
          I've deleted the contact page in favour of including contact buttons in the footer.
          I think the footer looks pretty clean and it also looks good on mobile. I've also 
          changed simple presentational things like the background image, changing different pages
          to different colours. I really like these changes.</p>
        <p>Also, today I've set up Git Version control with my 'my-website' repository on Github.
          This was a slightly confusing process but it's all up and running now. When I
          first started the website, I just uploaded the pages as I went, keeping my fingers 
          crossed that it would all be okay. This worked well initially but as I've been adding 
          more and more code, the potential pitfalls were becoming far greater - especially as I'd
          like to add more complex features as I go on. I also cloned the repository to my computer
          so I can work on my website on my preferred text-editor, and so I can work on it whilst
          offline.</p>

        <h3>What I’m working on at the moment: Smart Home (06/05/2021)</h3>
        <p>I love smart home set ups and I’m currently working on my own. So 
          far, I’ve made most of the lights in my bedroom ‘smart’. As well as 
          being able to control individual lights, I also have shortcuts set up 
          to control multiple lights at once, and shortcuts that control a mix 
          of lights and other things. I control all of these on my phone either: 
          via my iPhone ‘remote’* or via Siri.</p>
          
        <!--
        <h4>Examples of my shortcuts:</h4>
        <h4>‘bedtime’</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>turns off all the lights</li><br>
          <li>lowest phone brightness</li><br>
          <li>switches on dark mode</li><br>
          <li>switches on do not disturb</li><br>
          <li>switches on aeroplane mode</li><br>
          <li>sets phone volume to 5%</li><br>
          <li>switches on a podcast</li><br>
          <li>(then switches it off after 15 minutes)</li><br>
          <li>(if blinds aren’t already shut, shut them)</li><br>
        </ul>

        <h4>‘morning’</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>gets the sunrise time – if it’s before sunrise, the lights turn on
          </li><br>
          <li>40% brightness</li><br>
          <li>switches on light mode</li><br>
          <li>switches off do not disturb off</li><br>
          <li>switches off aeroplane mode</li><br>
          <li>(if it’s after sunrise time, open the blinds)</li><br>
        </ul>
        -->
          
        <p>I have a few more ideas for my smart home set up. For example, 
          although I have a smart plug to turn my floor lamp on and off, I’m 
          unable to remotely control the strength of the light, so I’d like to 
          build an implement to control the dimmer switches. I’d also like to 
          be able to open and close my blinds remotely and to perform some tasks
          automatically when triggered by motion sensors. I’m not sure how to go
          about all of these but I do have some ideas. I’ve got a Raspberry Pi 
          and the Pythonista app on iPhone so I’ll definitely be using these in 
          some way!<br><br></p>
          
        <h4>I’ve had some initial thoughts of important things to consider:</h4>
          <ul>
          <li>I’ll need to keep a record of which ‘direction’ the motor went in 
          previously because I don’t want to damage my lamp or blinds.</li><br>
          <li>I’ll need two motors for each dimmer switch, these will need to 
          be small in order to not get in one other’s way.</li><br>
          <li>I’ll need one motor for the blinds.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <h3>What I’m working on at the moment: This website</h3>
        <p>At the moment I am working on this website.
        Below, I have drafted ideas I would like to include.</p>
        <h3>What would I like to include on my website?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Document my programming projects in a portfolio</li><br>
          <li>Information on my skills and experience</li><br>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>What steps should I take?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a navigation toolbar</li><br>
          <li>How to adjust for mobile navigation</li><br>
          <li>CV I would like to do like an animated timeline?</li><br>
          <li>design: what colours, shapes</li><br>
          <li>add javascript</li><br>
          <li>what animations?</li><br>
          <li>an animation when it starts</li><br>
          <li>for portfolio, have a title, but then you can click for more info</li><br>
          <li>(then have a link to another page for further details)</li><br>
          <li>mobile formatting - maybe instead of a header, have a side menu?</li><br>
          <li>add google analytics?</li><br>
        </ul>
